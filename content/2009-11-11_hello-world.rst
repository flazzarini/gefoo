Hi, this is the first entry on my new blog site. On this site you'll find
in the near future information about all kinds of stuff, but mainly
linux stuff. I was eager to get a blog up to share my knowledge about
interesting stuff that I setup at work and at home. I hope this blog
will expand, and will grow with useful information over time.

That's all I have to say right now. But before I leave you guys to it
I'll just have to add tux to this blog.

Thanks and good night.
