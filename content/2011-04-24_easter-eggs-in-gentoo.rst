As it is easter time, I though I would compile a list of funny easter
eggs that you can find in `Gentoo`_. Why gentoo, cause I simply love
this distro, it's all about customization/optimization and knowing
what's really going on on your system. I used to be a gentoo user for
about 4 years but switched to Ubuntu as I started working because of
lack of time. Now that I compiled together my new PC a Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz on a Asus P8P67 Deluxe Mainboard with 8 GB of Ram
(awesome machine) I though it was time to switch back to gentoo, cause
the recent decisions Canonical chose with the future of Ubuntu I got a
little pissed, and yeahh I wanted to be able to decide everything on my
own again, gentoo is just that. Build up your OS the way you imagined
it, the way you want it to function. But enough talk now let's get to
the main reason of this post ... **Easter Eggs**.

- **Let emerge ...mooo..**
  Simply open up a console and type as root ***emerge moo*** and say
  heillo to `Larry`_ the cow

- **Gentoo's religious beliefs**
  Simply open up a console and type as root ***who is god***
