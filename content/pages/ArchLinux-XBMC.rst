Welcome to my ArchLinux_ XBMC_ project. This project is just an
experiment of mine, that I wanted to try out how fast I could get a Linux
installation to work with XBMC_ installed onto it. The installation should
boot as fast as possible and should of course autoboot into XBMC_. Well I
played arround a little bit and after a day or two I had an already bloody as
hell fast booting installation, which made me happy. ArchLinux_ is perfect
for that kind of installations cause it doesn't load any bloat and it's just so
customizable. For testing purposes I've tried everything inside of a Virtual
Machine in VirtualBox and because of the glory of virtual machines I am sharing
my xbmc machine with you. If you want to play arround with it modify it or even
use it feel free. I am trying to keep this page update if I add changes to the
machine, or find some tweaking stuff that I can do with it to make boot even
faster.
