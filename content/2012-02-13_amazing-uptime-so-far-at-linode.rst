Here a prove of how awesome the hosting @ `linode`_ really is. If you
are looking for a hosting provider which offers a lot with an easy to
use dashboard to configure/install your OS, look no further. I had my
machine running for more than **470 days**, but I had to reboot in order
to boot to the latest kernel. Here is a screenshot of htop showing the
uptime.
