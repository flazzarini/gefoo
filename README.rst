These are the ''pelican_'' source files for my blog General-Foo_. Use this repository as an example on how to get ''pelican_'' working.

To get started make sure you have ''fabric_'' installed and execute the following to create a development environment.

::

    fab develop

You now should have a fully working development environment. Here you can compile the html pages for the entire blog by executing

::

    make html


Have fun
